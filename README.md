**Abstract** 
1. The algorithm described in this paper aims to achieve Gesture recognition in identifying American Sign Language Symbols. There are a total of 29 characters that were added to the image database for the model to classify. 
2. The Database includes 87,000 images and more than 1200 images per character. Since it is a multiclass classification problem, a CNN model is implemented. The primary objective of the algorithm is to correctly classify all the gestures that are mapped on the proposed ASL Alphabet matrix integrated with the Digital Signage. 
3. This is done using OpenCV Library which captures the real-time feed and is then converted to grayscale that is provided as an input to the Convolutional Neural Network for the classification. 
4. The CNN model uses an ADAM optimizer that mediates the learning rate by quickly reaching the global minima based on the Vector Component Precedence.

**Keywords**: Gesture recognition - Multiclass - CNN - OpenCV - ADAM

**Dataset Used**
The data set used in the project was downloaded from Kaggle which contains about 87,000 images and approximately 1600 images per Alphabet.

**Proposed Drive-Thru Menu and UI**
1. The UI for the Project is a work in progress but the base model will have the following Front End which will be integrated with an external python script using Flask or Django Web Frameworks
2. The UI is being designed  in the form of a Progressive Web Application 
3. The initial stages of testing the UI have been implemented using CSS, JavaScript and HTML5
