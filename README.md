# ASL-Gesture-Analysis
**Abstract** 
1. The algorithm described in this paper aims to achieve Gesture recognition in identifying American Sign Language Symbols. There are a total of 29 characters that were added to the image database for the model to classify. 
2. The Database includes 87,000 images and more than 1200 images per character. Since it is a multiclass classification problem, a CNN model is implemented. The primary objective of the algorithm is to correctly classify all the gestures that are mapped on the proposed ASL Alphabet matrix integrated with the Digital Signage. 
3. This is done using OpenCV Library which captures the real-time feed and is then converted to grayscale that is provided as an input to the Convolutional Neural Network for the classification. 
4. The CNN model uses an ADAM optimizer that mediates the learning rate by quickly reaching the global minima based on the Vector Component Precedence.
